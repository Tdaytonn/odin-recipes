            <li>Sauté the onion, carrots, and celery, then add garlic.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste, then add wine to deglaze the pot.</li>
            <li>Return beef to the pot with broth, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently, covered, for 1.5 to 2 hours until the beef is nearly tender.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes until vegetables are tender. To thicken, you can simmer uncovered for the last part of cooking.</li>
            <li>Stir in peas, discard bay leaves and thyme, adjust seasoning, and garnish with parsley if desired.</li>
